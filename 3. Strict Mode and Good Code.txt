-> As we know that we can also declare a variable in JS without using any keyword also

user = "ayank"

-> this automatically makes it a var variable

-> although we should declare vars like this

=> TO ELIMINATE THESE BEHAVIOURS WE CAN USE STRICT MODE

..., to enable this mode on the script : "use strict"; -> in the beginning of the page

-> if I write : var undefined = 5; -> IT WORKS ✔️

-> but, this is a pre-defined keyword -> using strict mode -> it will not allow it ❌
