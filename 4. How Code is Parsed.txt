# HOW JS CODE IS PARSED AND COMPILED ?

-> JS code remains the same, but how that code is handled depends on the browser or the engine used 

-> PARSING : reading or loading of code

-> EXECUTION : actual working of code

..., to perform these 2 functions, every browser has an engine : Chrome's Engine(V8)

--> this Engine consists of 2 parts : Interpreter and Compiler

=> INTERPRETER -> parses script and starts execution line by line -> converts it to the byte code -> and then loads the code to compiler

=> COMPILER -> translation of interpreted code to the machine code -> JiT

Just In Time compilation : compiler starts compiling + executing the compiled code whilst the code is being read.

(whilst -> at the same time as / whereas)

--> then this compiled code is passed to the Computer 

-> then various optimzation techniques are used on that code
