# How the code gets executed ?

-> its all about managing memory + managing memory steps

-> here we have 2 important concepts :

1. HEAP : it is our long term memory -> browser taps into our system memory and manages the heap to store the stuff

-> the data that we use during the program is stored in the heap

2 STACK : it is short term memory -> it is used for code execution -> manages the functions and all

-> in stack, it always starts with the execution of some anonymous code i.e. the script file
